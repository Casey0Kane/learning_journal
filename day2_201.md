# Day 2 code 201
Today I learned a lot about javascript. The most challenging part of today was the lab assignment where we had to make an about us questionnaire. We had to make sure that the user could enter uppercase or lowercase answers using a new command that we have not learned yet. It took me awhile to figure out, and was definitely frustrating but felt really good when I finally got it. Playing around with Git and the terminal is more fun than I thought, that feel when you push your new file to GitHub is really amazing. I hope to learn more about javascript and how we can use it to do more complex things and accept more complex answers. I'm also looking forward to doing more with CSS and learning how to really style a website and make it look professional!
