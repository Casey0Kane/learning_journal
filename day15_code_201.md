# Day 15 code 201
Today we didn't really learn too much but we practiced a lot. We practiced merge conflicts and how to resolve them in git. We also watched the 301 classes presentations. It felt like we could already do most of what they showcased in their projects, the only problem would be the API. I can't believe that will be me in just over a month. Now to start working on my final project of the class, i'm nervous for Friday when everybody presents but thats always something I worry about. I wonder if I will get to use all three languages we've learned in the final project or if I will focus on one or two.
