# Day 12 code 201
Today we learned about adding charts to our data table from yesterdays lab. We used JsChart to put the data into a bar graph. This was a little confusing at first but once I was started the structure wasn't too hard to follow. Tomorrow we are learning how to make the data persist after a page refresh. That is going to be tough I think because we have no experience ever doing anything like it and I have no idea what the code is going to look like. Hopefully it isn't too bad and we learn kind of how to do it in class tomorrow. That's about it for today, I don't really know what else to write about.
