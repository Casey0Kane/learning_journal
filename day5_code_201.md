# Day 5 code 201
Today I learned about objects and functions in our lab today. It was a struggle for a little bit but once I got some help it seemed to make more sense. The hardest part was probably question 3 and figuring out how to add and multiply 3 values while only having 2 available. Once I figured out how to do that problem 4 and 5 were much easier. Understanding what question 4 took me a couple minutes to figure out. I'm excited that it's friday so I can finally relax for a bit before getting back to coding on monday. I hope what we learn next week makes more sense than some of the stuff this week.
