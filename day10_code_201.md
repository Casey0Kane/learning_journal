# Day 10 code 201
Today we learned about making a wireframe for a website, it turned out to be harder than I thought. Making the HTML didn't seem too hard and it wasn't but the dang CSS just wouldn't look right. I don't know what it is about CSS but I can never put things were I want them or edit them correctly. I can't figure out how to change the background color of an image or the text color of an image, I was wondering maybe if I needed to change the contrast but I didn't have any luck with that either. But i'm sure we will go over it on Monday and then i'll have a better understanding of how to make this page.
