<h1>Day 01 code 201</h1>
Today I learned a lot, I learned about MVC's (view controller model) all the way through unix commands. Some of the unix commands I learned are cd to change directory in the terminal. Mkdir to make a new directory. Cp to copy things from the terminal, and date/cal to provide the date and time. I learned about the present working directory and how absolute paths start with a /. We went over GitHub and how it can make collaborating easier between people merging their branches into a master commit. Git commands are very interesting, you can clone things or push your code to GitHub just by typing it! I learned to use underscores instead of spaces just like in the name of this document and how spaces are not recognized by computers the same way we interpret them. Overall it was a pretty good first day at Codefellows, I really like my instructor and doing this has actually winded me down a bit after a long day of lecture.
