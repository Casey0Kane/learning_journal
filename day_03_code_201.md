# Day 3 code 201
Today I barely survived, I had the hardest time with todays lab assignment. I just could not understand the for loops with the function, and it seems so simple too! I understand the concept but I just don't understand how to write it or put an array in. If i'm struggling this hard i'm not sure if i'm going to make it through this class. This is not the confidence booster I needed, maybe i'm just not smart enough. I feel like other people are understanding this right away and I have to ask for help so often. Man this has just been me complaining, I hope nobody actually reads this (i'm sorry if you do).
