# Day 6 code 201
Today I learned about object literals. This has probably been one of the more confusing days for me, which is surprising because i've been confused every day. I wonder if thats normal or if its just me. I'm understanding what I need to do in my head but actually coding it is really difficult, I keep forgetting variables and simple things like that. I kind of have the lab working but i'm not really sure if i'm doing it right. The whole process is kind of confusing today, I really hope I better understand it tomorrow and onwards, i'm looking forward to the code review so I can see how others did it differently and hopefully for Sam to explain it in more detail.
